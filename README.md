# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This is my first Web 3.0 project 😎 it demonstrates  basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a simple smart contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

The WavePortal allows you to authenticate your wallet by signing a transaction using MetaMask on the Rinkeby network allowing a user to send a frinedly 👋🏾 and see how many people have waved as well.


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

To test full functionality you would need to have access to Google Chrome, MetaMask and on the Rinkeby network.
